        <P>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is
            a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and
            coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.</P>
